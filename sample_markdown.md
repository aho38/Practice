### Sample Markdown Page ###
The markdown language is what will be used to document the progress of your work throughout the internship.
It is a system similar to that used in wikipidia. There are certain things we cannot go over until you get there
because of the nature of their security, but this will form the basis of your documentation.

### REMEMBER ### 
Nothing is saved in these types of pages until you commit changes at the bottom. 

### Headers ###
Headers are a nice way to seperate the sections, they are made using hashtag signs. The number of hashtags determines the 
size of the header. The hashtags require a space after in order to signify a header.

#Header1#
# Header 1 #

##Header2##
## Header 2 ##

###Header3###
### Header3 ###

In order to create horizontal rule lines you can use three or more hyphens - - -

----

**Bold** text is created using ** text **
*Italicized* text is created using * text *

### Hyperlinks ###
You can use an inline link by using \[I'm an inline-style link]\(https://www.google.com) which will appear as [I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

You can also include links using angle brackets \<https://www.google.com> which appears as <https://www.google.com> .

### Adding Images ###
You will be given a seperate repository for all of your images. In this repository all of our images are housed in the imgs file and images are incorporated using the imgs folder

 Here we use the following code to display the image \![alt text]\(imgs/repolink.png "Title")
 
 ![plane](imgs/plane.jpg "Plane")
