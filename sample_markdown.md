### Sample Markdown Page ###
The markdown language is what will be used to document the progress of your work throughout the internship.
It is a system similar to that used in wikipidia. There are certain things we cannot go over until you get there
because of the nature of their security, but this will form the basis of your documentation.

### REMEMBER ### 
Nothing is saved in these types of pages until you commit changes at the bottom. 

### Headers ###
Headers are a nice way to seperate the sections, they are made using hashtag signs. The number of hashtags determines the 
size of the header. The hashtags require a space after in order to signify a header.

#Header1#
# Header 1 #

##Header2##
## Header 2 ##

###Header3###
### Header3 ###
